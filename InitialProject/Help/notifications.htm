    <h1>Notifications</h1>
    Here you can find all your notifications. There are two groups: one related to tour attendance confirmation and the other related to accepted tour requests.
    <br />
    As you can see, there are <b>VIEW</b> and <b>DELETE</b> buttons. <b>VIEW</b> provides you with all the information about that notification, while <b>DELETE</b> allows you to remove the notification if you wish to do so.
