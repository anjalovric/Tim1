    <h1>Requests</h1>
    Here, you can see all your requests for both regular and complex tours. The difference between these two types is that a complex tour consists of multiple regular tours.

    In the <b>Ordinary</b> tab, only the requests marked as regular will be displayed, excluding those that are part of a complex tour. Besides the name of the tour, you can also see the status of each request.</br>
    In the <b>Ordinary</b> tab, the status of a request can be one of the following:

    <b>ACCEPTED</b>: if the request has been accepted.
    <b>ON WAITING</b>: if the request is still pending.
    <b>INVALID</b>: if the request has not been accepted, and the deadline has passed.
    In the <b>Complex</b> tab, you will find the complex tours and their status. The status follows the same criteria as for regular tours, but for a complex tour to have the status <b>ACCEPTED</b>, all its parts must be accepted.

    You also have the <b>Request parts</b> field, which allows you to view the individual parts of a complex tour. If a part has been accepted, you will be able to see the scheduled start time set by the guide. Otherwise, you will see a message indicating that the request is still pending.
